# GenderDetectionUsingML
The proposed system describes gender
detection based on Computer Vision and Machine Learning Approach using Convolutional

Neural Network (CNN) which is used to extract various facial feature. First, the facial-
extraction is investigated and best features are introduced which would be useful for training

and testing the dataset. This learning representation is taken through the use of convolution
neural network. Which reveals that the proposed system is tested across various challenging
levels of face datasets and gives excellent performance efficiency of the system with gender
detection rate for each of the database. This whole system is introduced by the simple and easy
hardware implementation on Raspberry Pi programmed using Python.
